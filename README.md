# INTRODUCTION
In this project, I have completed all the exercises in the Bandit category on OverTheWire.org and documented each step in a repository.
OverTheWire.org is an online platform that provides a series of cybersecurity and systems challenges designed to help participants learn and improve their skills in the field of security.
The Bandit category serves as an excellent introduction to system security and the use of the Unix command line. Throughout the levels, various challenges are presented that cover concepts such as directory traversal, file manipulation, basic Unix command usage, vulnerability exploitation, and more.

# PROCESS
To complete these challenges, I employed a variety of tools and techniques, including executing commands in the terminal, writing custom scripts, analyzing files, and understanding basic principles of cybersecurity. Each level has been meticulously documented in my repository, providing clear explanations and step-by-step processes used to solve the challenges.

# UTILITY
By maintaining a detailed record of my solutions in the repository, I aim to provide a helpful reference for those interested in learning about cybersecurity and overcoming challenges on OverTheWire.org. Furthermore, this project has allowed me to acquire and enhance practical skills in system security and has helped me develop an analytical approach to solving security-related problems.

# FOR THE COMMUNITY
I invite anyone interested in learning or improving their skills in cybersecurity to explore my repository, where they will find a comprehensive, step-by-step guide to all the exercises in the Bandit category on OverTheWire.org. I hope this project proves valuable to those seeking to learn about system security and the Unix command line, and I encourage them to continue challenging themselves with other levels and categories on OverTheWire.org.

# RESULTS
This proyect has been successfully finished.
